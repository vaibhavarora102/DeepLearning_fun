0,love,"I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."
1,love,"You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,Love like you'll never be hurt,Sing like there's nobody listening,And live like it's heaven on earth."

7,love,"Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life."
8,love,"As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."
9,love,"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference."
10,love,"It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."
11,love,"I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."
12,love,"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."
13,love,Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.
14,love,"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."
15,love,"This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about."
16,love,"There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment."
17,love,Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.
18,love,"You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there."
19,love,"You love me. Real or not real?""I tell him, ""Real."
20,love,"I'm in love with you,"" he said quietly.""Augustus,"" I said.""I am,"" he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. ""I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you."
21,love,"I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.."
22,love,"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind."
23,love,"Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it."
24,love,"People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master..."
25,love,"You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not."
26,love,"There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature."
27,love,"If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything."
28,love,"We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love."
29,love,"Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."
30,love,If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever.
31,love,The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space.
32,love,"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."
33,love,"Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.""After all this time?""""Always,"" said Snape."
34,love,"When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable."
35,love,I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing.
36,love,To die will be an awfully big adventure.
37,love,"A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."
38,love,"So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday."
39,love,"Just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. And just when you think it can't get any better, it can."
40,love,Tis better to have loved and lostThan never to have loved at all.
41,love,"I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul."
42,love,"He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you."
43,love,"The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person."
44,love,"When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too."
45,love,"I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together."
46,love,One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.
47,love,"When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always."
48,love,Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone's bad qualities because they somehow complete you.
49,love,We love the things we love for what they are.
50,love,In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
51,love,"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
52,love,"Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love."
53,love,I would die for you. But I won't live for you.
54,love,"So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."
55,love,Never love anyone who treats you like you're ordinary.
56,love,"I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)I am never without it (anywhereI go you go,my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing,my darling)I fear no fate (for you are my fate,my sweet)I want no world (for beautiful you are my world,my true)and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is youhere is the deepest secret nobody knows(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which growshigher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apartI carry your heart (I carry it in my heart)"
57,love,The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you.
58,love,"You are, and always have been, my dream."
59,love,"You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together."
60,love,"And now I’m looking at you,” he said, “and you’re asking me if I still want you, as if I could stop loving you. As if I would want to give up the thing that makes me stronger than anything else ever has. I never dared give much of myself to anyone before – bits of myself to the Lightwoods, to Isabelle and Alec, but it took years to do it – but, Clary, since the first time I saw you, I have belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me."
61,love,I would always rather be happy than dignified.
62,love,"Promise YourselfTo be so strong that nothingcan disturb your peace of mind.To talk health, happiness, and prosperityto every person you meet.To make all your friends feelthat there is something in themTo look at the sunny side of everythingand make your optimism come true.To think only the best, to work only for the best,and to expect only the best.To be just as enthusiastic about the success of othersas you are about your own.To forget the mistakes of the pastand press on to the greater achievements of the future.To wear a cheerful countenance at all timesand give every living creature you meet a smile.To give so much time to the improvement of yourselfthat you have no time to criticize others.To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,not in loud words but great deeds.To live in faith that the whole world is on your sideso long as you are true to the best that is in you."
63,love,"He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."
64,love,Where there is love there is life.
65,love,"I think you still love me, but we can’t escape the fact that I’m not enough for you. I knew this was going to happen. So I’m not blaming you for falling in love with another woman. I’m not angry, either. I should be, but I’m not. I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt, but I was wrong."
66,love,"Some women choose to follow men, and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you're wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn't love you anymore."
67,love,"Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love."
68,love,"Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold."
69,love,"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that's what you've given me. That's what I'd hoped to give you forever"
70,love,"Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering."
71,love,"Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet."
72,love,"There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."
73,love,Doubt thou the stars are fire;Doubt that the sun doth move;Doubt truth to be a liar;But never doubt I love.
74,love,"We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."
75,love,We loved with a love that was more than love.
76,love,"This is a good sign, having a broken heart. It means we have tried for something."
77,love,"Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something."
78,love,Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field.I'll meet you there.When the soul lies down in that grassthe world is too full to talk about.
79,love,"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb…"" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word.""What a stupid lamb,"" I sighed.""What a sick, masochistic lion."
80,love,"I heard what you said. I’m not the silly romantic you think. I don’t want the heavens or the shooting stars. I don’t want gemstones or gold. I have those things already. I want…a steady hand. A kind soul. I want to fall asleep, and wake, knowing my heart is safe. I want to love, and be loved."
81,love,"A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever"
82,love,"The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!"
83,love,I have decided to stick to love...Hate is too great a burden to bear.
84,love,"We live and breathe words. .... It was books that made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them. Reading your words, what you wrote, how you were lonely sometimes and afraid, but always brave; the way you saw the world, its colors and textures and sounds, I felt--I felt the way you thought, hoped, felt, dreamt. I felt I was dreaming and thinking and feeling with you. I dreamed what you dreamed, wanted what you wanted--and then I realized that truly I just wanted you."
85,love,What's meant to be will always find a way
86,love,"They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."
87,love,Hearts are made to be broken.
88,love,"Two people in love, alone, isolated from the world, that's beautiful."
89,love,"I have a history of making decisions very quickly about men. I have always fallen in love fast and without measuring risks. I have a tendency not only to see the best in everyone, but to assume that everyone is emotionally capable of reaching his highest potential. I have fallen in love more times than I care to count with the highest potential of a man, rather than with the man himself, and I have hung on to the relationship for a long time (sometimes far too long) waiting for the man to ascend to his own greatness. Many times in romance I have been a victim of my own optimism."
90,love,"The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."
91,love,"This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."
92,love,"No relationship is perfect, ever. There are always some ways you have to bend, to compromise, to give something up in order to gain something greater...The love we have for each other is bigger than these small differences. And that's the key. It's like a big pie chart, and the love in a relationship has to be the biggest piece. Love can make up for a lot."
93,love,"Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes."
94,love,"For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home."
95,love,"Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love."
96,love,"They didn’t agree on much. In fact, they didn’t agree on anything. They fought all the time and challenged each other ever day. But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other."
97,love,"Love is so short, forgetting is so long."
98,love,"You could have had anything else in the world, and you asked for me.""She smiled up at him. Filthy as he was, covered in blood and dirt, he was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.""But I don't want anything else in the world."
99,love,"I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff."
100,love,The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
101,love,"If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger."
102,love,There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.
103,love,"If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets."
104,love,"To douchebags!"" he said, gesturing to Brad. ""And to girls that break your heart,"" he bowed his head to me. His eyes lost focus. ""And to the absolute fucking horror of losing your best friend because you were stupid enough to fall in love with her."
105,love,"Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it."
106,love,"What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me. A mutual addiction."
107,love,"Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new."
108,love,"What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again."
109,love,"My daddy said, that the first time you fall in love, it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try, that feeling just never goes away."
110,love,"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."
111,love,"It hurts to let go. Sometimes it seems the harder you try to hold on to something or someone the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt, for having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. It confuses you, because you think that your feelings were wrong and it makes you feel so small because it's so hard to keep it inside when you let it out and it doesn't coma back. You're left so alone that you can't explain. Damn, there's nothing like that, is there? I've been there and you have too. You're nodding your head."
112,love,"Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction."
113,love,"And, in the endThe love you takeis equal to the love you make."
114,love,"I don't trust people who don't love themselves and tell me, 'I love you.' ... There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt."
115,love,"If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do. If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. “Busy” is another word for “asshole.” “Asshole” is another word for the guy you’re dating. You deserve a fcking phone call."
116,love,"It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight."
117,love,"If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were."
118,love,"I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, 'How many good things have you done in your life?' rather he will ask, 'How much love did you put into what you did?"
119,love,"Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell."
120,love,"We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong person—someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, “This is the problem I want to have.”I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way."
121,love,"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."
122,love,"My dear,Find what you love and let it kill you.Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.Let it kill you and let it devour your remains.For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but it’s much better to be killed by a lover.~ Falsely yours"
123,love,"You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have."
124,love,"I have something I need to tell you,"" he says. I run my fingers along the tendons in his hands and look back at him. ""I might be in love with you."" He smiles a little. ""I'm waiting until I'm sure to tell you, though.""""That's sensible of you,"" I say, smiling too. ""We should find some paper so you can make a list or a chart or something.""I feel his laughter against my side, his nose sliding along my jaw, his lips pressing my ear.""Maybe I'm already sure,"" he says, ""and I just don't want to frighten you.""I laugh a little. ""Then you should know better.""""Fine,"" he says. ""Then I love you."
125,love,"If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible. If he has to make a choice, may he make it now. Then I will either wait for him or forget him."
126,love,"More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate."
127,love,"I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, 'So now that you've got me, what are you going to do with me?' I turn into him. 'Put you somewhere you can't get hurt."
128,love,"Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow."
129,love,Be the reason someone smiles. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people.
130,love,Be careful of love. It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.
131,love,How many slams in an old screen door? Depends how loud you shut it. How many slices in a bread? Depends how thin you cut it. How much good inside a day? Depends how good you live 'em. How much love inside a friend? Depends how much you give 'em.
132,love,"Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up."
133,love,"It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done."
134,love,When love is not madness it is not love.
135,love,"If you like her, if she makes you happy, and if you feel like you know her---then don't let her go."
136,love,"I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts."
137,love,"Well, it seems to me that the best relationships - the ones that last - are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with."
138,love,Declarations of love amuse me. Especially when unrequited.
139,love,"True love is rare, and it's the only thing that gives life real meaning."
140,love,I love you more than there are stars in the sky and fish in the sea.
141,love,A woman's heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her.
142,love,"What's this?"" he demanded, looking from Clary to his companions, as if they might know what she was doing there.""It's a girl,"" Jace said,recovering his composure. ""Surely you've seen girls before, Alec. Your sister Isabelle is one."
143,love,"Do you think I'm pretty?I think you're beautifulBeautiful?You are so beautiful, it hurts sometimes."
144,love,"The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much, and forgetting that you are special too."
145,love,I love you. Remember. They cannot take it
146,love,"I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be."
147,love,"I was smiling yesterday,I am smiling today and I will smile tomorrow.Simply because life is too short to cry for anything."
148,love,Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired.
149,love,أجمل حب هو الذي نعثر عليه أثناء بحثنا عن شيء آخر
150,love,"If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain."
151,love,"It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them. "
152,love,"Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness."
153,love,"I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it's these things I'd believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn't all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything."
154,love,"When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace."
155,love,What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.
156,love,All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.
157,love,"Hate the sin, love the sinner."
158,love,Find what you love and let it kill you.
159,love,"Well, nowIf little by little you stop loving meI shall stop loving youLittle by littleIf suddenly you forget meDo not look for meFor I shall already have forgotten youIf you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my lifeAnd you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have rootsRememberThat on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my armsAnd my roots will set off to seek another land"
160,love,"What Is Love? I have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul"
161,love,"We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved."
162,love,The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.
163,love,"There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet. ""Is this the moment?"" Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. ""OI! There's a war going on here!"" Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. ""I know, mate,"" said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, ""so it's now or never, isn't it?"" ""Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?"" Harry shouted. ""D'you think you could just --- just hold it in, until we've got the diadem?"" ""Yeah --- right --- sorry ---"" said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face."
164,love,It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.
165,love,"The greater the love, the greater the tragedy when it's over."
166,love,"One love, one heart, one destiny."
167,love,"If you gave someone your heart and they died, did they take it with them? Did you spend the rest of forever with a hole inside you that couldn't be filled?"
168,love,"If she's amazing, she won't be easy. If she's easy, she won't be amazing. If she's worth it, you wont give up. If you give up, you're not worthy. ... Truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for."
169,love,Never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart.
170,love,"It isn't possible to love and part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal."
171,love,"Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect."
172,love,Any fool can be happy. It takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep.
173,love,"It's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful."
174,love,"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well."
175,love,Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time.
176,love,"They say when you are missing someone that they are probably feeling the same, but I don't think it's possible for you to miss me as much as I'm missing you right now"
177,love,I wantTo do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.
178,love,"You know, when it works, love is pretty amazing. It's not overrated. There's a reason for all those songs."
179,love,Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.
180,love,"Even if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around. Life is too short to waste your time on people who don’t respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend your life with people who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved."
181,love,"Love is not affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person's ultimate good as far as it can be obtained."
182,love,"We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love."
183,love,I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only. I would like to be that unnoticed and that necessary.
184,love,Top 15 Things Money Can’t BuyTime. Happiness. Inner Peace. Integrity. Love. Character. Manners. Health. Respect. Morals. Trust. Patience. Class. Common sense. Dignity.
185,love,As if you were on fire from within.The moon lives in the lining of your skin.
186,love,"To me, Fearless is not the absense of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death."
187,love,"He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It’s his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry."
188,love,I love you like a fat kid loves cake!
189,love,"We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and—in spite of True Romance magazines—we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely—at least, not all the time—but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness."
190,love,"It’s probably not just by chance that I’m alone. It would be very hard for a man to live with me, unless he’s terribly strong. And if he’s stronger than I, I’m the one who can’t live with him. … I’m neither smart nor stupid, but I don’t think I’m a run-of-the-mill person. I’ve been in business without being a businesswoman, I’ve loved without being a woman made only for love. The two men I’ve loved, I think, will remember me, on earth or in heaven, because men always remember a woman who caused them concern and uneasiness. I’ve done my best, in regard to people and to life, without precepts, but with a taste for justice."
191,love,"And when her lips met mine, I knew that I could live to be a hundred and visit every country in the world, but nothing would ever compare to that single moment when I first kissed the girl of my dreams and knew that my love would last forever."
192,love,"Welcome to the wonderful world of jealousy, he thought. For the price of admission, you get a splitting headache, a nearly irresistable urge to commit murder, and an inferiority complex. Yippee."
193,love,"Tonight I can write the saddest linesI loved her, and sometimes she loved me too."
194,love,"Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift."
195,love,Look after my heart - I've left it with you.
196,love,"Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused."
197,love,"The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them"
198,love,"You couldn't relive your life, skipping the awful parts, without losing what made it worthwhile. You had to accept it as a whole--like the world, or the person you loved."
199,love,"Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being ""in love"", which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident."
200,love,"Life, he realize, was much like a song. In the beginning there is mystery, in the end there is confirmation, but it's in the middle where all the emotion resides to make the whole thing worthwhile."
201,love,You can't measure the mutual affection of two human beings by the number of words they exchange.
202,love,Happiness [is] only real when shared
203,love,"How do you spell 'love'?"" - Piglet""You don't spell it...you feel it."" - Pooh"
204,love,"I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair.Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets. Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps. I hunger for your sleek laugh, your hands the color of a savage harvest, hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, the sovereign nose of your arrogant face, I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes, and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, hunting for you, for your hot heart, Like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue."
205,love,"I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity."
206,love,And then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me.
207,love,"Maybe...you'll fall in love with me all over again.""""Hell,"" I said, ""I love you enough now. What do you want to do? Ruin me?""""Yes. I want to ruin you.""""Good,"" I said. ""That's what I want too."
208,love,Letting go doesn't mean that you don't care about someone anymore. It's just realizing that the only person you really have control over is yourself.
209,love,"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars, points of light and reason. ...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn’t see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason, for anything."
210,religion,Anyone who thinks sitting in church can make you a Christian must also think that sitting in a garage can make you a car.
211,religion,"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."
212,religion,"The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us."
213,religion,"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."
214,religion,"For those who believe in God, most of the big questions are answered. But for those of us who can't readily accept the God formula, the big answers don't remain stone-written. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state, and our educational system. We are here to drink beer. We are here to kill war. We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us."
215,religion,"When his life was ruined, his family killed, his farm destroyed, Job knelt down on the ground and yelled up to the heavens, ""Why god? Why me?"" and the thundering voice of God answered, There's just something about you that pisses me off."
216,religion,"The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.."
217,religion,"Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money!"
218,religion,Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one's weakness. It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart.
219,religion,God has no religion.
220,religion,"In heaven, all the interesting people are missing."
221,religion,"Hate the sin, love the sinner."
222,religion,A man can no more diminish God's glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word 'darkness' on the walls of his cell.
223,religion,"Knock, And He'll open the doorVanish, And He'll make you shine like the sunFall, And He'll raise you to the heavensBecome nothing, And He'll turn you into everything."
224,religion,I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time.
225,religion,Science and religion are not at odds. Science is simply too young to understand.
226,religion,A truth that's told with bad intentBeats all the lies you can invent.
227,religion,Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?
228,religion,"Atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning..."
229,religion,"Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god. Whereas owners of cats are compelled to realize that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they draw the conclusion that they are gods."
230,religion,"Forgive, O Lord, my little jokes on TheeAnd I'll forgive Thy great big one on me."
231,religion,"My concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God's side, for God is always right."
232,religion,"Sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of (another)... There are just some kind of men who - who're so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results."
233,religion,"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,"" he began, ""especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?""""They go to hell,"" was my ready and orthodox answer.""And what is hell? Can you tell me that?""""A pit full of fire.""""And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?""""No, sir.""""What must you do to avoid it?""I deliberated a moment: my answer, when it did come was objectionable: ""I must keep in good health and not die."
234,religion,All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not seen.
235,religion,"He died not for men, but for each man. If each man had been the only man made, He would have done no less."
236,religion,"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard, are sweeter"
237,religion,"I believe in God, but not as one thing, not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us. I believe that what Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha and all the rest said was right. It's just that the translations have gone wrong."
238,religion,"Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities."
239,religion,"When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad. That's my religion."
240,religion,Is man merely a mistake of God's? Or God merely a mistake of man?
241,religion,My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness.

244,religion,God save us from people who mean well.
245,religion,"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"
246,religion,"Thou hast made us for thyself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it finds its rest in thee."
247,religion,No woman wants to be in submission to a man who isn't in submission to God!
248,religion,"All religion, my friend, is simply evolved out of fraud, fear, greed, imagination, and poetry."
249,religion,"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully."

251,religion,"There are people in the world so hungry, that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread."
252,religion,"He - and if there is a God, I am convinced he is a he, because no woman could or would ever fuck things up this badly."

259,religion,"To terrify children with the image of hell, to consider women an inferior creation—is that good for the world?"
260,religion,"I'm completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. ... These two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death."
261,religion,Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet. Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich.
262,religion,"I can see how it might be possible for a man to look down upon the earth and be an atheist, but I cannot conceive how a man could look up into the heavens and say there is no God."
263,religion,"People, I thought, wanted security. They couldn't bear the idea of death being a big black nothing, couldn't bear the thought of their loved ones not existing, and couldn't even imagine themselves not existing. I finally decided that people believed in an afterlife because they couldn't bear not to."
264,religion,The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried.
265,religion,The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.
266,religion,"Yes, reason has been a part of organized religion, ever since two nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake."
267,religion,"Look for God, suggests my Guru. Look for God like a man with his head on fire looks for water."
268,religion,"Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ""Do it again""; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ""Do it again"" to the sun; and every evening, ""Do it again"" to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we."
269,religion,I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist.
270,religion,"I have never made but one prayer to God, a very short one: Oh Lord, make my enemies ridiculous. And God granted it.""(Letter to Étienne Noël Damilaville, May 16, 1767)"
271,religion,"If complete and utter chaos was lightning, then he'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armour and shouting 'All gods are bastards!"
272,religion,"I believe in good and evil,"" said Jem. ""And I believe the soul is eternal. But I don't believe in the fiery pit, the pitchforks, or endless torment. I do not believe you can threaten people into goodness.""Tessa looked at will. ""What about you? What do you believe?""Pulvis et umbra sumus,"" said Will, not looking at her as he spoke. ""I believe we are dust and shadows. What else is there?"
273,religion,"If this is going to be a Christian nation that doesn't help the poor, either we have to pretend that Jesus was just as selfish as we are, or we've got to acknowledge that He commanded us to love the poor and serve the needy without condition and then admit that we just don't want to do it."
274,religion,"My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone."
275,religion,Do not wait for the last judgment. It comes every day.
276,religion,"I think it's perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing God into it, but I don't know everything, and there may well be a God somewhere, hiding away. Actually, if he is keeping out of sight, it's because he's ashamed of his followers and all the cruelty and ignorance they're responsible for promoting in his name. If I were him, I'd want nothing to do with them."
277,religion,"In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion."
278,religion,"Atheism is more than just the knowledge that gods do not exist, and that religion is either a mistake or a fraud. Atheism is an attitude, a frame of mind that looks at the world objectively, fearlessly, always trying to understand all things as a part of nature."
279,religion,It is easy enough to be friendly to one's friends. But to befriend the one who regards himself as your enemy is the quintessence of true religion. The other is mere business.
280,religion,"I have no idea what's awaiting me, or what will happen when this all ends. For the moment I know this: there are sick people and they need curing."
281,religion,"In truth,there was only one christian and he died on the cross."

284,religion,"This is my simple religion. No need for temples. No need for complicated philosophy. Your own mind, your own heart is the temple. Your philosophy is simple kindness."
285,religion,"There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it."
286,religion,"Science investigates; religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge, which is power; religion gives man wisdom, which is control. Science deals mainly with facts; religion deals mainly with values. The two are not rivals."
287,religion,"Isn't it funny how the memories you cherish before a breakup can become your worst enemies afterwards? The thoughts you loved to think about, the memories you wanted to hold up to the light and view from every angle--it suddenly seems a lot safer to lock them in a box, far from the light of day and throw away the key. It's not an act of bitterness. It's an act if self-preservation. It's not always a bad idea to stay behind the window and look out at life instead, is it?"
288,religion,Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.
289,religion,It is when we notice the dirt that God is most present in us; it is the very sign of His presence.
290,religion,"You would not have called to me unless I had been calling to you,"" said the Lion."
291,religion,belief is the death of intelligence.
292,religion,The dog is a gentleman; I hope to go to his heaven not man's.
293,religion,الندم هو صوت الفطرة لحظة الخطأ
294,religion,"In all of living, have much fun and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed, not just endured."
295,religion,"And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence"
296,religion,"Alcohol may be man's worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy."
297,religion,"Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both."
298,religion,"How many observe Christ's birthday! How few, His precepts!"
299,religion,There is not enough love and goodness in the world to permit giving any of it away to imaginary beings.
300,religion,"When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion."
301,religion,"Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death--ought to decide, indeed, to earn one's death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible for life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return."
302,religion,No man can be called friendless who has God and the companionship of good books.
303,religion,"I don't deserve a soul, yet I still have one. I know because it hurts."
304,religion,"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow, it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally, I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time."
305,religion,"Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this: when we as a species abandon our trust in a power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability. Faiths… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable. With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. The church consists of a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control."
306,religion,"It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished."
307,religion,He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.
308,religion,One would go mad if one took the Bible seriously; but to take it seriously one must be already mad.
309,religion,God is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere.
310,religion,Do you think it's possible for an entire nation to be insane?
311,religion,What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.
312,religion,"I wore black because I liked it. I still do, and wearing it still means something to me. It's still my symbol of rebellion -- against a stagnant status quo, against our hypocritical houses of God, against people whose minds are closed to others' ideas."
313,religion,"I challenge anyone to understand Islam, its spirit, and not to love it. It is a beautiful religion of brotherhood and devotion."
314,religion,"You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too."
315,religion,"Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour ... If at my convenience I might break them, what would be their worth?"
316,religion,"I seem to have run in a great circle, and met myself again on the starting line."
317,religion,"With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil - that takes religion."
318,religion,Better to sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunk Christian.
319,religion,"We are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone."
320,religion,"CALVIN:This whole Santa Claus thing just doesn't make sense. Why all the secrecy? Why all the mystery?If the guy exists why doesn't he ever show himself and prove it?And if he doesn't exist what's the meaning of all this?HOBBES:I dunno. Isn't this a religious holiday? CALVIN:Yeah, but actually, I've got the same questions about God."
321,religion,"What is it you most dislike? Stupidity, especially in its nastiest forms of racism and superstition."
322,religion,I don't want to believe. I want to know.
323,religion,"Yes, the long war on Christianity. I pray that one day we may live in an America where Christians can worship freely! In broad daylight! Openly wearing the symbols of their religion... perhaps around their necks? And maybe -- dare I dream it? -- maybe one day there can be an openly Christian President. Or, perhaps, 43 of them. Consecutively."
324,religion,Imagine there's no countriesIt isn't hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion tooImagine all the peopleLiving life in peaceYou may say that I'm a dreamerBut I'm not the only oneI hope someday you'll join usAnd the world will be as one
325,religion,There is no God and we are his prophets.
326,religion,"I don't know how you feel, but I'm pretty sick of church people. You know what they ought to do with churches? Tax them. If holy people are so interested in politics, government, and public policy, let them pay the price of admission like everybody else. The Catholic Church alone could wipe out the national debt if all you did was tax their real estate."
327,religion,"If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile."
328,religion,"Man is the Reasoning Animal. Such is the claim. I think it is open to dispute. Indeed, my experiments have proven to me that he is the Unreasoning Animal... In truth, man is incurably foolish. Simple things which other animals easily learn, he is incapable of learning. Among my experiments was this. In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends. I put them in a cage. In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit. In the course of two days I was able to add a fox, a goose, a squirrel and some doves. Finally a monkey. They lived together in peace; even affectionately.Next, in another cage I confined an Irish Catholic from Tipperary, and as soon as he seemed tame I added a Scotch Presbyterian from Aberdeen. Next a Turk from Constantinople; a Greek Christian from Crete; an Armenian; a Methodist from the wilds of Arkansas; a Buddhist from China; a Brahman from Benares. Finally, a Salvation Army Colonel from Wapping. Then I stayed away for two whole days. When I came back to note results, the cage of Higher Animals was all right, but in the other there was but a chaos of gory odds and ends of turbans and fezzes and plaids and bones and flesh--not a specimen left alive. These Reasoning Animals had disagreed on a theological detail and carried the matter to a Higher Court."
329,religion,"How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths."
330,religion,"We keep on being told that religion, whatever its imperfections, at least instills morality. On every side, there is conclusive evidence that the contrary is the case and that faith causes people to be more mean, more selfish, and perhaps above all, more stupid."
331,religion,"If there is any religion that could respond to the needs of modern science, it would be Buddhism."
332,religion,"The hardest thing of all is to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat."
333,religion,Religious liberty might be supposed to mean that everybody is free to discuss religion. In practice it means that hardly anybody is allowed to mention it.
334,religion,"Ya Rabb, Engkaulah alasan semua kehidupan ini. Engkaulah penjelasan atas semua kehidupan ini. Perasaan itu datang dariMu. Semua perasaan itu juga akan kembali kepadaMu. Kami hanya menerima titipan. Dan semua itu ada sungguh karenaMu...Katakanlah wahai semua pencinta di dunia. Katakanlah ikrar cinta itu hanya karenaNya. Katakanlah semua kehidupan itu hanya karena Allah. Katakanlah semua getar-rasa itu hanya karena Allah. Dan semoga Allah yang Maha Mencinta, yang Menciptakan dunia dengan kasih-sayang mengajarkan kita tentang cinta sejati. Semoga Allah memberikan kesempatan kepada kita untuk merasakan hakikatNya.Semoga Allah sungguh memberikan kesempatan kepada kita untuk memandang wajahNya. Wajah yang akan membuat semua cinta dunia layu bagai kecambah yang tidak pernah tumbuh. Layu bagai api yang tak pernah panas membakar. Layu bagai sebongkah es yang tidak membeku. "
335,religion,My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.
336,religion,Only priests and fools are fearless and I've never been on the best of terms with God.
337,religion,God is a concept by which we measure our pain.
338,religion,Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.
339,religion,"The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive."
340,religion,"What have I always believed?That on the whole, and by and large, if a man lived properly, not according to what any priests said, but according to what seemed decent and honest inside, then it would, at the end, more or less, turn out all right."
341,religion,"I love you when you bow in your mosque, kneel in your temple, pray in your church. For you and I are sons of one religion, and it is the spirit."
342,religion,"Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you—even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers, and triumphs over all opposition. Religions are places to stand and look and act, vantage points from which to view the world. So none of this is happening. Such things could not occur. Never a word of it is literally true."
343,religion,"A child is not a Christian child, not a Muslim child, but a child of Christian parents or a child of Muslim parents. This latter nomenclature, by the way, would be an excellent piece of consciousness-raising for the children themselves. A child who is told she is a 'child of Muslim parents' will immediately realize that religion is something for her to choose -or reject- when she becomes old enough to do so."
344,religion,From the beginning men used God to justify the unjustifiable.
345,religion,"You were made by God and for God and until you understand that, life will never make sense."
346,religion,"I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms."
347,religion,"Well, while you were in the bathroom, I sat down at this picnic table here in Bumblefug, Kentucky, and noticed that someone had carved that GOD HATES FAG, which, aside from being a grammatical nightmare, is absolutely ridiculous. So I'm changing it to 'God Hates Baguettes.' It's tough to disagree with that. Everybody hates baguettes."
348,religion,Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.
349,religion,"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead —his eyes are closed. The insight into the mystery of life, coupled though it be with fear, has also given rise to religion. To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms—this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness."
350,religion,"There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously - no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption."
351,religion,"About once or twice every month I engage in public debates with those whose pressing need it is to woo and to win the approval of supernatural beings. Very often, when I give my view that there is no supernatural dimension, and certainly not one that is only or especially available to the faithful, and that the natural world is wonderful enough—and even miraculous enough if you insist—I attract pitying looks and anxious questions. How, in that case, I am asked, do I find meaning and purpose in life? How does a mere and gross materialist, with no expectation of a life to come, decide what, if anything, is worth caring about?Depending on my mood, I sometimes but not always refrain from pointing out what a breathtakingly insulting and patronizing question this is. (It is on a par with the equally subtle inquiry: Since you don't believe in our god, what stops you from stealing and lying and raping and killing to your heart's content?) Just as the answer to the latter question is: self-respect and the desire for the respect of others—while in the meantime it is precisely those who think they have divine permission who are truly capable of any atrocity—so the answer to the first question falls into two parts. A life that partakes even a little of friendship, love, irony, humor, parenthood, literature, and music, and the chance to take part in battles for the liberation of others cannot be called 'meaningless' except if the person living it is also an existentialist and elects to call it so. It could be that all existence is a pointless joke, but it is not in fact possible to live one's everyday life as if this were so. Whereas if one sought to define meaninglessness and futility, the idea that a human life should be expended in the guilty, fearful, self-obsessed propitiation of supernatural nonentities… but there, there. Enough."
352,religion,Sometimes you can see things happen right in front of your eyes and still jump to the wrong conclusions.
353,religion,Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last.
354,religion,"Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains ... an unuprooted small corner of evil. Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety, but it is possible to constrict it within each person."
355,religion,"Just because I do not accept the teachings of the devotaries does not mean I've discarded a belief in right and wrong.""""But the Almighty determines what is right!""""Must someone, some unseen thing, declare what is right for it to be right? I believe that my own morality -- which answers only to my heart -- is more sure and true than the morality of those who do right only because they fear retribution."
356,religion,"Your question is the most difficult in the world. It is not a question I can answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things."
357,religion,"Perhaps not one religion contains all of the truth of the world. Perhaps every religion contains fragments of the truth, and it is our responsibility to identify those fragments and piece them together."
358,religion,"Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse."
359,religion,Doubt isn't the opposite of faith; it is an element of faith.
360,religion,"If Jesus came back and saw what was being done in his name, he'd never stop throwing up."
361,religion,"It is truth that liberates, not your effort to be free."
362,religion,"If you think God’s there, He is. If you don’t, He isn’t. And if that’s what God’s like, I wouldn’t worry about it."
363,religion,"The more I learn about the universe, the less convinced I am that there's any sort of benevolent force that has anything to do with it, at all."
364,religion,Music is my higher power
365,religion,"Night poured over the desert. It came suddenly, in purple. In the clear air, the stars drilled down out of the sky, reminding any thoughtful watcher that it is in the deserts and high places that religions are generated. When men see nothing but bottomless infinity over their heads they have always had a driving and desperate urge to find someone to put in the way."
366,religion,"Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;Where knowledge is free;Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;Where words come out from the depth of truth;Where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection;Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action -Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake."
367,religion,What has he found who has lost God?And what has he lost who has found God?
368,religion,"I did not marry the first girl that I fell in love with, because there was a tremendous religious conflict, at the time. She was an atheist, and I was an agnostic."
369,religion,Photons have mass? I didn’t even know they were Catholic.
370,religion,"The real question of life after death isn't whether or not it exists, but even if it does what problem this really solves."
371,religion,God doesn’t need to punish us. He just grants us a long enough life to punish ourselves.
372,religion,"If there's only one nation in the sky, shouldn't all passports be valid for it?"
373,religion,I’m an atheist and I thank God for it.
374,religion,"...legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties."
375,religion,Civilization will not attain to its perfection until the last stone from the last church falls on the last priest.
376,religion,We have a choice. We have two options as human beings. We have a choice between conversation and war. That's it. Conversation and violence. And faith is a conversation stopper.
377,religion,I call him religious who understands the suffering of others.
378,religion,A young man who wishes to remain a sound atheist cannot be too careful of his reading.
379,religion,"Gods prefer simple, vicious games, where you Do Not Achieve Transcendence but Go Straight To Oblivion; a key to the understanding of all religion is that a god's idea of amusement is Snakes and Ladders with greased rungs."
380,religion,"The word 'God' is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation, no matter how subtle, can (for me) change this."
381,religion,"I consider it an extremely dangerous doctrine, because the more likely we are to assume that the solution comes from the outside, the less likely we are to solve our problems ourselves."
382,religion,"In every age it has been the tyrant, the oppressor and the exploiter who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism, or religion, or both to deceive and overawe the People."
383,religion,"Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat wearing Muslims."
384,religion,"Governments want efficient technicians, not human beings, because human beings become dangerous to governments – and to organized religions as well. That is why governments and religious organizations seek to control education."
385,religion,All religions are true but none are literal.
386,religion,"Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous."
387,religion,Aim at Heaven and you will get Earth 'thrown in': aim at Earth and you will get neither.
388,religion,"All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom."
389,religion,"Words do not express thoughts very well; every thing immediately becomes a little different, a little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems right that what is of value and wisdom of one man seems nonsense to another."
390,religion,I have as much authority as the Pope. I just don’t have as many people who believe it.
391,religion,The most confused you will ever get is when you try to convince your heart and spirit of something your mind knows is a lie.
392,religion,"I suppose that one reason I have always detested religion is its sly tendency to insinuate the idea that the universe is designed with 'you' in mind or, even worse, that there is a divine plan into which one fits whether one knows it or not. This kind of modesty is too arrogant for me."
393,religion,I have so much to do that I shall spend the first three hours in prayer.
394,religion,"I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage"
395,religion,"Almost any sect, cult, or religion will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do so."
396,religion,I would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a man nailed to two pieces of wood.
397,religion,"There are random moments - tossing a salad, coming up the driveway to the house, ironing the seams flat on a quilt square, standing at the kitchen window and looking out at the delphiniums, hearing a burst of laughter from one of my children's rooms - when I feel a wavelike rush of joy. This is my true religion: arbitrary moments of of nearly painful happiness for a life I feel privileged to lead."
398,religion,Do not abandon yourselves to despair. We are the Easter people and hallelujah is our song.
399,religion,I believe in the fundamental truth of all great religions of the world.
400,religion,"Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about."
401,religion,"Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies."
402,religion,"Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is – I repeat it – a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them."
403,religion,"To be fair, much of the Bible is not systematically evil but just plain weird, as you would expect of a chaotically cobbled-together anthology of disjointed documents, composed, revised, translated, distorted and 'improved' by hundreds of anonymous authors, editors and copyists, unknown to us and mostly unknown to each other, spanning nine centuries"
404,religion,"Oh, Adam’s sons, how cleverly you defend yourselves against all that might do you good!"
405,religion,"Religion isn't the cause of wars, it's the excuse."
406,religion,The minute you get a religion you stop thinking. Believe in one thing too much and you have no room for new ideas.
407,religion,We should live our lives as though Christ was coming this afternoon.
408,religion,"To live by grace means to acknowledge my whole life story, the light side and the dark. In admitting my shadow side I learn who I am and what God's grace means."
409,religion,"I have found God, but he is insufficient."
410,religion,"I think the reason we sometimes have the false sense that God is so far away is because that is where we have put him. We have kept him at a distance, and then when we are in need and call on him in prayer, we wonder where he is. He is exactly where we left him."
411,religion,"The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality of happiness, and by no means a necessity of life."
412,religion,"I came to the conclusion long ago that all religions were true and that also that all had some error in them, and while I hold by my own religion, I should hold other religions as dear as Hinduism. So we can only pray, if we were Hindus, not that a Christian should become a Hindu; but our innermost prayer should be that a Hindu should become a better Hindu, a Muslim a better Muslim, and a Christian a better Christian."
413,religion,"When we blindly adopt a religion, a political system, a literary dogma, we become automatons."
414,religion,"Religion is still useful among the herd - that it helps their orderly conduct as nothing else could. The crude human animal is in-eradicably superstitious, and there is every biological reason why they should be. Take away his Christian god and saints, and he will worship something else..."
415,religion,There's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.
416,religion,"The Savage interrupted him. ""But isn't it natural to feel there's a God?"" ""You might as well ask if it's natural to do up one's trousers with zippers,"" said the Controller sarcastically. ""You remind me of another of those old fellows called Bradley. He defined philosophy as the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct. As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. Finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons–that's philosophy. People believe in God because they've been conditioned to."
417,religion,"When people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the big bang, so there is no time for god to make the universe in. It’s like asking directions to the edge of the earth; The Earth is a sphere; it doesn’t have an edge; so looking for it is a futile exercise. We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is; there is no god. No one created our universe,and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization; There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful."
418,religion,A preoccupation with the next world clearly shows an inability to cope credibly with this one.
419,religion,"To see and feel one's beloved naked for the first time is one of life's pure, irreducible epiphanies. If there is a true religion in the universe, it must include that truth of contact or be forever hollow. To make love to the one true person who deserves that love is one of the few absolute rewards of being a human being, balancing all of the pain, loss, awkwardness, loneliness, idiocy, compromise, and clumsiness that go with the human condition. To make love to the right person makes up for a lot of mistakes."
420,philosophy,Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
421,philosophy,Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
422,philosophy,"Without music, life would be a mistake."
423,philosophy,"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference."
424,philosophy,Go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company.
425,philosophy,A day without laughter is a day wasted.

431,philosophy,Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.
432,philosophy,"We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be."
433,philosophy,"One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away."
434,philosophy,"If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?"
435,philosophy,"It is hard enough to remember my opinions, without also remembering my reasons for them!"
436,philosophy,"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."
437,philosophy,Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.
438,philosophy,"A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
439,philosophy,Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something.
440,philosophy,You do not write your life with words...You write it with actions. What you think is not important. It is only important what you do.
441,philosophy,"Simplicity, patience, compassion.These three are your greatest treasures.Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being.Patient with both friends and enemies,you accord with the way things are.Compassionate toward yourself,you reconcile all beings in the world."
442,philosophy,Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.
443,philosophy,"Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible."
444,philosophy,"Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!"
445,philosophy,"There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest."
446,philosophy,"Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric."
447,philosophy,"Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we're partisans of liberty, then it's our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!"
448,philosophy,The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.
449,philosophy,"A woman has to live her life, or live to repent not having lived it."
450,philosophy,We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.

457,philosophy,Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.
458,philosophy,"Let's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all."
459,philosophy,The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
460,philosophy,A truth that's told with bad intentBeats all the lies you can invent.
461,philosophy,I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think
462,philosophy,Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know.

467,philosophy,"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard, are sweeter"
468,philosophy,A paranoid is someone who knows a little of what's going on. 
469,philosophy,"For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you."
470,philosophy,Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.
471,philosophy,It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.
472,philosophy,Music is ... A higher revelation than all Wisdom & Philosophy
473,philosophy,The easy confidence with which I know another man's religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also.
474,philosophy,A concept is a brick. It can be used to build a courthouse of reason. Or it can be thrown through the window.
475,philosophy,"An intellectual? Yes. And never deny it. An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself. I like this, because I am happy to be both halves, the watcher and the watched. ""Can they be brought together?"" This is a practical question. We must get down to it. ""I despise intelligence"" really means: ""I cannot bear my doubts."
476,philosophy,"Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each."
477,philosophy,"Like all magnificent things, it's very simple."
478,philosophy,"I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always ... so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you."
479,philosophy,Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people we personally dislike.
480,philosophy,"If you win, you need not have to explain...If you lose, you should not be there to explain!"

484,philosophy,"It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams."
485,philosophy,A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.
486,philosophy,"Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies."
487,philosophy,"Is it possible, in the final analysis, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another?We can invest enormous time and energy in serious efforts to know another person, but in the end, how close can we come to that person's essence? We convince ourselves that we know the other person well, but do we really know anything important about anyone?"
488,philosophy,"Let children read whatever they want and then talk about it with them. If parents and kids can talk together, we won't have as much censorship because we won't have as much fear."
489,philosophy,"Sometimes I lie awake at night and I ask, ""Is life a multiple choice test or is it a true or false test?"" ...Then a voice comes to me out of the dark and says, ""We hate to tell you this but life is a thousand word essay."
490,philosophy,The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
491,philosophy,"Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."
492,philosophy,"Nothing was ever in tune. People just blindly grabbed at whatever there was: communism, health foods, zen, surfing, ballet, hypnotism, group encounters, orgies, biking, herbs, Catholicism, weight-lifting, travel, withdrawal, vegetarianism, India, painting, writing, sculpting, composing, conducting, backpacking, yoga, copulating, gambling, drinking, hanging around, frozen yogurt, Beethoven, Back, Buddha, Christ, TM, H, carrot juice, suicide, handmade suits, jet travel, New York City, and then it all evaporated and fell apart. People had to find things to do while waiting to die. I guess it was nice to have a choice."
493,philosophy,"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."
494,philosophy,"I don’t know what’s worse: to not know what you are and be happy, or to become what you’ve always wanted to be, and feel alone."
495,philosophy,"It's not all bad. Heightened self-consciousness, apartness, an inability to join in, physical shame and self-loathing—they are not all bad. Those devils have been my angels. Without them I would never have disappeared into language, literature, the mind, laughter and all the mad intensities that made and unmade me."
496,philosophy,I would believe only in a God that knows how to dance.
497,philosophy,"The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything."
498,philosophy,The first duty of a man is to think for himself
499,philosophy,"Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Heres Tom with the Weather."
500,philosophy,"If you're going to kick authority in the teeth, you might as well use two feet."

507,philosophy,Time is a game played beautifully by children.
508,philosophy,"If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, ""He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone."
509,philosophy,"I started my life with a single absolute: that the world was mine to shape in the image of my highest values and never to be given up to a lesser standard, no matter how long or hard the struggle."
510,philosophy,"Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens."
511,philosophy,"We have come from God, and inevitably the myths woven by us, though they contain error, will also reflect a splintered fragment of the true light, the eternal truth that is with God. Indeed only by myth-making, only by becoming 'sub-creator' and inventing stories, can Man aspire to the state of perfection that he knew before the Fall. Our myths may be misguided, but they steer however shakily towards the true harbour, while materialistic 'progress' leads only to a yawning abyss and the Iron Crown of the power of evil."
512,philosophy,"Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well."
513,philosophy,"I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings."
514,philosophy,The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.
515,philosophy,"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.[These words are also inscribed upon his grave]"
516,philosophy,Perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.
517,philosophy,"Man is a mystery. It needs to be unravelled, and if you spend your whole life unravelling it, don't say that you've wasted time. I am studying that mystery because I want to be a human being."
518,philosophy,"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman."
519,philosophy,I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong.
520,philosophy,"He suddenly recalled from Plato's Symposium: People were hermaphrodites until God split then in two, and now all the halves wander the world over seeking one another. Love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost."
521,philosophy,"Maybe each human being lives in a unique world, a private world different from those inhabited and experienced by all other humans. . . If reality differs from person to person, can we speak of reality singular, or shouldn't we really be talking about plural realities? And if there are plural realities, are some more true (more real) than others? What about the world of a schizophrenic? Maybe it's as real as our world. Maybe we cannot say that we are in touch with reality and he is not, but should instead say, His reality is so different from ours that he can't explain his to us, and we can't explain ours to him. The problem, then, is that if subjective worlds are experienced too differently, there occurs a breakdown in communication ... and there is the real illness."
522,philosophy,"A person who has not been completely alienated, who has remained sensitive and able to feel, who has not lost the sense of dignity, who is not yet ""for sale"", who can still suffer over the suffering of others, who has not acquired fully the having mode of existence - briefly, a person who has remained a person and not become a thing - cannot help feeling lonely, powerless, isolated in present-day society. He cannot help doubting himself and his own convictions, if not his sanity. He cannot help suffering, even though he can experience moments of joy and clarity that are absent in the life of his ""normal"" contemporaries. Not rarely will he suffer from neurosis that results from the situation of a sane man living in an insane society, rather than that of the more conventional neurosis of a sick man trying to adapt himself to a sick society. In the process of going further in his analysis, i.e. of growing to greater independence and productivity,his neurotic symptoms will cure themselves."
523,philosophy,"No! Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try."
524,philosophy,"I know that pain is the most important thing in the universes. Greater than survival, greater than love, greater even than the beauty it brings about. For without pain, there can be no pleasure. Without sadness, there can be no happiness. Without misery there can be no beauty. And without these, life is endless, hopeless, doomed and damned. Adult. You have become adult."
525,philosophy,"If you understand others you are smart.If you understand yourself you are illuminated.If you overcome others you are powerful.If you overcome yourself you have strength.If you know how to be satisfied you are rich.If you can act with vigor, you have a will.If you don't lose your objectives you can be long-lasting.If you die without loss, you are eternal."
526,philosophy,One of the penalties of refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.
527,philosophy,"I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts."
528,philosophy,"For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?"
529,philosophy,"Doubt as sin. — Christianity has done its utmost to close the circle and declared even doubt to be sin. One is supposed to be cast into belief without reason, by a miracle, and from then on to swim in it as in the brightest and least ambiguous of elements: even a glance towards land, even the thought that one perhaps exists for something else as well as swimming, even the slightest impulse of our amphibious nature — is sin! And notice that all this means that the foundation of belief and all reflection on its origin is likewise excluded as sinful. What is wanted are blindness and intoxication and an eternal song over the waves in which reason has drowned."
530,philosophy,"It does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters,"
531,philosophy,The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible.
532,philosophy,The flame that burns Twice as bright burns half as long.
533,philosophy,The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.
534,philosophy,"I shiver, thinking how easy it is to be totally wrong about people-to see one tiny part of them and confuse it for the whole, to see the cause and think it's the effect or vice versa"
535,philosophy,Things do not change; we change.
536,philosophy,Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it.
537,philosophy,The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.
538,philosophy,"Man is always prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them."
539,philosophy,Wisest is she who knows she does not know.
540,philosophy,belief is the death of intelligence.
541,philosophy,People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don't know is what what they do does.
542,philosophy,The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him.
543,philosophy,"What you are is God's gift to you, what you become is your gift to God."
544,philosophy,The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.
545,philosophy,The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.
546,philosophy,"Non est ad astra mollis e terris via"" - ""There is no easy way from the earth to the stars"
547,philosophy,Some people talk in their sleep. Lecturers talk while other people sleep
548,philosophy,"I don't deserve a soul, yet I still have one. I know because it hurts."
549,philosophy,Happiness consists in frequent repetition of pleasure
550,philosophy,"You show me a capitalist, and I'll show you a bloodsucker"
551,philosophy,You are an aperture through which the universe is looking at and exploring itself.
552,philosophy,If it turns out that there is a God...the worst that you can say about him is that basically he's an underachiever.
553,philosophy,"It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished."
554,philosophy,"He died that day because his body had served its purpose. His soul had done what it came to do, learned what it came to learn, and then was free to leave."
555,philosophy,"No one should ever ask themselves that: why am I unhappy? The question carries within it the virus that will destroy everything. If we ask that question, it means we want to find out what makes us happy. If what makes us happy is different from what we have now, then we must either change once and for all or stay as we are, feeling even more unhappy."
556,philosophy,"Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?"
557,philosophy,"If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the government is inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change."
558,philosophy,"The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance."
559,philosophy,I don't want to be a tree; I want to be its meaning.
560,philosophy,Cinema is the ultimate pervert art. It doesn't give you what you desire - it tells you how to desire.
561,philosophy,"Know thyself? If I knew myself, I'd run away."
562,philosophy,"Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding... And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy"
563,philosophy,"To lose a brother is to lose someone with whom you can share the experience of growing old, who is supposed to bring you a sister-in-law and nieces and nephews, creatures who people the tree of your life and give it new branches. To lose your father is to lose the one whose guidance and help you seek, who supports you like a tree trunk supports its branches. To lose your mother, well, that is like losing the sun above you. It is like losing--I'm sorry, I would rather not go on."
564,philosophy,"On the whole human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time."
565,philosophy,Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.
566,philosophy,"Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I’ve said before, bugs in amber."
567,philosophy,"It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I'd been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration."
568,philosophy,"Devotion to the truth is the hallmark of morality; there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking."
569,philosophy,"The seed of suffering in you may be strong, but don't wait until you have no more suffering before allowing yourself to be happy."
570,philosophy,Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
571,philosophy,"I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves."
572,philosophy,I was never aware of any other option but to question everything.
573,philosophy,There are no ordinary moments.
574,philosophy,"It may be important to great thinkers to examine the world, to explain and despise it. But I think it is only important to love the world, not to despise it, not for us to hate each other, but to be able to regard the world and ourselves and all beings with love, admiration and respect."
575,philosophy,"When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you."
576,philosophy,"Don’t only practice your art, but force your way into its secrets, for it and knowledge can raise men to the divine."
577,philosophy,"The highest activity a human being can attain is learning for understanding, because to understand is to be free."
578,philosophy,The menu is not the meal.
579,philosophy,"She said, ""It's not life or death, the labyrinth.""""Um, okay. So what is it?""""Suffering,"" she said. ""Doing wrong and having wrong things happen to you. That's the problem. Bolivar was talking about the pain, not about the living or dying. How do you get out of the labyrinth of suffering?... Nothing's wrong. But there's always suffering, Pudge. Homework or malaria or having a boyfriend who lives far away when there's a good-looking boy lying next to you. Suffering is universal. It's the one thing Buddhists, Christians, and Muslims are all worried about."
580,philosophy,All knowledge is worth having.
581,philosophy,"We should forgive our enemies, but not before they are hanged"
582,philosophy,"It's no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. You've got to stick to it all your life. Only at times, at times, the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it, all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in, when they come. But they've got to come. You can't force them."
583,philosophy,"Take it easy, but take it."
584,philosophy,"I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell."
585,philosophy,"Don't just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents."
586,philosophy,"The most important reason for going from one place to another is to see what's in between, and they took great pleasure in doing just that."
587,philosophy,No single event can awaken within us a stranger whose existence we had never suspected. To live is to be slowly born.
588,philosophy,"But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown."
589,philosophy,"The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next."
590,philosophy,"The so-called paradox of freedom is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in Plato.Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal."
591,philosophy,"The evil that is in the world almost always comes from ignorance, and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding."
592,philosophy,"Anyway—because we are readers, we don't have to wait for some communications executive to decide what we should think about next—and how we should think about it. We can fill our heads with anything from aardvarks to zucchinis—at any time of night or day."

610,philosophy,Stop feeling sorry for yourself and you will be happy.
611,philosophy,"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges."
612,philosophy,"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent."
613,philosophy,A cult is a religion with no political power.
614,philosophy,"My desire and wish is that the things I start with should be so obvious that you wonder why I spend my time stating them. This is what I aim at because the point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it."
615,philosophy,"Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty."
616,philosophy,"There is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life, just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, just be happy. You are already free!"
617,philosophy,"Until an hour before the Devil fell, God thought him beautiful in Heaven."
618,philosophy,"Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man."
619,philosophy,"Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not."
620,philosophy,"The words ‘I Love You’ kill, and resurrect millions, in less than a second."
621,philosophy,"Perhaps not one religion contains all of the truth of the world. Perhaps every religion contains fragments of the truth, and it is our responsibility to identify those fragments and piece them together."

628,philosophy,"He was free, free in every way, free to behave like a fool or a machine, free to accept, free to refuse, free to equivocate; to marry, to give up the game, to drag this death weight about with him for years to come. He could do what he liked, no one had the right to advise him, there would be for him no Good or Evil unless he thought them into being."
629,philosophy,"When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they wind up becoming a part of that person's life. And then they want the person to change. If someone isn't what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own."

646,happiness,"They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for."

You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it. You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it."

He was sitting up now, leaning forward.""I can't.""""I know. They never let you be famous AND happy."" He lifted an eyebrow. ""I'll tell you a secret.""""Tell me."" I loved it when he was like this.""I'm going to be the first."" He took my palm and held it to his. ""Swear it.""""Why me?""""Because you're the reason. Swear it.""""I swear it,"" I said, lost in the high color of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes.""I swear it,"" he echoed.We sat like that a moment, hands touching. He grinned.""I feel like I could eat the world raw."
699,happiness,"It was only a sunny smile, and little it cost in the giving, but like morning light it scattered the night and made the day worth living."
700,happiness,"Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it"

705,happiness,Happiness depends on your mindset and attitude.
706,happiness,"I know that's what people say-- you'll get over it. I'd say it, too. But I know it's not true. Oh, youll be happy again, never fear. But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him."
707,happiness,Happiness depends upon ourselves.
708,happiness,"Sometimes life knocks you on your ass... get up, get up, get up!!! Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them."
709,happiness,"Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand."
710,happiness,Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.
711,happiness,"I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy."
712,happiness,"People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility."
713,happiness,"True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not."
714,happiness,"I don’t know what’s worse: to not know what you are and be happy, or to become what you’ve always wanted to be, and feel alone."
715,happiness,"I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh."
716,happiness,Happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length.
717,happiness,"Part of the problem with the word 'disabilities' is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can't feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren't able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities."
718,happiness,"What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine."
719,happiness,"A quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one's neighbor — such is my idea of happiness."
720,happiness,With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.
721,happiness,"There is some kind of a sweet innocence in being human- in not having to be just happy or just sad- in the nature of being able to be both broken and whole, at the same time."
722,happiness,"Generally speaking, the most miserable people I know are those who are obsessed with themselves; the happiest people I know are those who lose themselves in the service of others...By and large, I have come to see that if we complain about life, it is because we are thinking only of ourselves."
723,happiness,"There is nothing more rare, nor more beautiful, than a woman being unapologetically herself; comfortable in her perfect imperfection. To me, that is the true essence of beauty."
724,happiness,"Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."
725,happiness,"Ester asked why people are sad.""That’s simple,"" says the old man. ""They are the prisoners of their personal history. Everyone believes that the main aim in life is to follow a plan. They never ask if that plan is theirs or if it was created by another person. They accumulate experiences, memories, things, other people's ideas, and it is more than they can possibly cope with. And that is why they forget their dreams."
726,happiness,"Happily ever after, or even just together ever after, is not cheesy,” Wren said. “It’s the noblest, like, the most courageous thing two people can shoot for."
727,happiness,Smile more. Smiling can make you and others happy.
728,happiness,"Maybe the truth is, there's a little bit of loser in all of us. Being happy isn't having everything in your life be perfect. Maybe it's about stringing together all the little things."
729,happiness,The problem with people is they forget that most of the time it's the small things that count.
730,happiness,There are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate more and more. The other is to desire less.
731,happiness,"Those who are not looking for happiness are the most likely to find it, because those who are searching forget that the surest way to be happy is to seek happiness for others."
732,happiness,"Happiness is an accident of nature, a beautiful and flawless aberration."
733,happiness,"We don’t even ask happiness, just a little less pain."
734,happiness,"Sadness gives depth. Happiness gives height. Sadness gives roots. Happiness gives branches. Happiness is like a tree going into the sky, and sadness is like the roots going down into the womb of the earth. Both are needed, and the higher a tree goes, the deeper it goes, simultaneously. The bigger the tree, the bigger will be its roots. In fact, it is always in proportion. That's its balance."
735,happiness,"Stop giving other people the power to control your happiness, your mind, and your life. If you don't take control of yourself and your own life, someone else is bound to try."
736,happiness,"This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."
737,happiness,Whoever is happy will make others happy.
738,happiness,"The secret of happiness is freedom, the secret of freedom is courage."
739,happiness,"You’ll learn, as you get older, that rules are made to be broken. Be bold enough to live life on your terms, and never, ever apologize for it. Go against the grain, refuse to conform, take the road less traveled instead of the well-beaten path. Laugh in the face of adversity, and leap before you look. Dance as though EVERYBODY is watching. March to the beat of your own drummer. And stubbornly refuse to fit in."
740,happiness,"I'm choosing happiness over suffering, I know I am. I'm making space for the unknown future to fill up my life with yet-to-come surprises."

744,happiness,I have a million things to talk to you about. All I want in this world is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning.
745,happiness,"Happiness is not a possession to be prized, it is a quality of thought, a state of mind."
746,happiness,"After all, what is happiness? Love, they tell me. But love doesn't bring and never has brought happiness. On the contrary, it's a constant state of anxiety, a battlefield; it's sleepless nights, asking ourselves all the time if we're doing the right thing. Real love is composed of ecstasy and agony."
747,happiness,"Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free."
748,happiness,"I have no faith in human perfectibility. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago."
749,happiness,People are unhappy when they get something too easily. You have to sweat--that's the only moral they know.
750,happiness,"A smile puts you on the right track. A smile makes the world a beautiful place. When you lose your smile, you lose your way in the chaos of life."

757,happiness,"Children are happy because they don't have a file in their minds called ""All the Things That Could Go Wrong."
758,happiness,"Perfectionism is the enemy of happiness. Embrace being perfectly imperfect. Learn from your mistakes and forgive yourself, you’ll be happier. We make mistakes because we are imperfect. Learn from your mistakes, forgive yourself, and keep moving forward."
759,happiness,"I, not events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today. I can choose which it shall be. Yesterday is dead, tomorrow hasn't arrived yet. I have just one day, today, and I'm going to be happy in it."
760,happiness,"Don’t sacrifice yourself too much, because if you sacrifice too much there’s nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you."

769,happiness,"The greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances."
770,happiness,"The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist; a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain."
771,happiness,"There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort."
772,happiness,"What can I do with my happiness? How can I keep it, conceal it, bury it where I may never lose it? I want to kneel as it falls over me like rain, gather it up with lace and silk, and press it over myself again."
773,happiness,The pain I feel now is the happiness I had before. That's the deal.
774,happiness,"I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow, than a man swear he loves me."
775,happiness,"Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it."
776,happiness,"I heard a definition once: Happiness is health and a short memory! I wish I'd invented it, because it is very true."
777,happiness,"It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the young know they are wretched for they are full of the truthless ideal which have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real, they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of life."
778,happiness,"I am a happy camper so I guess I’m doing something right. Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder."
779,happiness,I am very happyBecause I have conquered myselfAnd not the world.I am very happyBecause I have loved the worldAnd not myself.
780,happiness,"I find the best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves."
781,happiness,That's the difference between me and the rest of the world! Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria!
782,happiness,"The sense of unhappiness is so much easier to convey than that of happiness. In misery we seem aware of our own existence, even though it may be in the form of a monstrous egotism: this pain of mine is individual, this nerve that winces belongs to me and to no other. But happiness annihilates us: we lose our identity."
783,happiness,"Let us dance in the sun, wearing wild flowers in our hair..."
784,happiness,I don't think that there are any limits to how excellent we could make life seem.
785,happiness,Happiness consists in frequent repetition of pleasure
786,happiness,This life is yours. Take the power to choose what you want to do and do it well. Take the power to love what you want in life and love it honestly. Take the power to walk in the forest and be a part of nature. Take the power to control your own life. No one else can do it for you. Take the power to make your life happy.
787,happiness,"If only we'd stop trying to be happy, we could have a pretty good time."
788,happiness,I'm a kind of paranoiac in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.
789,happiness,I've always thought people would find a lot more pleasure in their routines if they burst into song at significant moments.
790,happiness,"It takes three to make love, not two: you, your spouse, and God. Without God people only succeed in bringing out the worst in one another. Lovers who have nothing else to do but love each other soon find there is nothing else. Without a central loyalty life is unfinished."
791,happiness,"No one should ever ask themselves that: why am I unhappy? The question carries within it the virus that will destroy everything. If we ask that question, it means we want to find out what makes us happy. If what makes us happy is different from what we have now, then we must either change once and for all or stay as we are, feeling even more unhappy."
792,happiness,"Happiness. It was the place where passion, with all its dazzle and drumbeat, met something softer: homecoming and safety and pure sunbeam comfort. It was all those things, intertwined with the heat and the thrill, and it was as bright within her as a swallowed star."
793,happiness,"If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war. If the government is inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad, better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag. Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change."
794,happiness,"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."
795,happiness,And therein lies the whole of man's plight. Human time does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line. That is why man cannot be happy: happiness is the longing for repetition.
796,happiness,"Life is not a PG feel-good movie. Real life often ends badly. Literature tries to document this reality, while showing us it is still possible for us to endure nobly."
797,happiness,"Even if things don't unfold the way you expected, don't be disheartened or give up. One who continues to advance will win in the end."
798,happiness,The only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down.
799,happiness,"The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate."
800,happiness,"Happiness is a risk. If you’re not a little scared, then you’re not doing it right."
801,happiness,My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.
802,happiness,Most of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people.
803,happiness,"The belief that unhappiness is selfless and happiness is selfish is misguided. It's more selfless to act happy. It takes energy, generosity, and discipline to be unfailingly lighthearted, yet everyone takes the happy person for granted. No one is careful of his feelings or tries to keep his spirits high. He seems self-sufficient; he becomes a cushion for others. And because happiness seems unforced, that person usually gets no credit."
804,happiness,There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power or our will. 
805,happiness,You cannot be with someone just because you don’t want to hurt him. You have your own happiness to think about.
806,happiness,"It is a curious thing, but as one travels the world getting older and older, it appears that happiness is easier to get used to than despair. The second time you have a root beer float, for instance, your happiness at sipping the delicious concoction may not be quite as enormous as when you first had a root beer float, and the twelfth time your happiness may be still less enormous, until root beer floats begin to offer you very little happiness at all, because you have become used to the taste of vanilla ice cream and root beer mixed together. However, the second time you find a thumbtack in your root beer float, your despair is much greater than the first time, when you dismissed the thumbtack as a freak accident rather than part of the scheme of a soda jerk, a phrase which here means ""ice cream shop employee who is trying to injure your tongue,"" and by the twelfth time you find a thumbtack, your despair is even greater still, until you can hardly utter the phrase ""root beer float"" without bursting into tears. It is almost as if happiness is an acquired taste, like coconut cordial or ceviche, to which you can eventually become accustomed, but despair is something surprising each time you encounter it."
807,happiness,All who joy would winMust share it -- Happiness was born a twin.
808,happiness,Success is getting what you want..Happiness is wanting what you get.
809,happiness,"Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - ' It destroys everything around it, except itself '. Self pity will destroy relationships, it'll destroy anything that's good, it will fulfill all the prophecies it makes and leave only itself. And it's so simple to imagine that one is hard done by, and that things are unfair, and that one is underappreciated, and that if only one had had a chance at this, only one had had a chance at that, things would have gone better, you would be happier if only this, that one is unlucky. All those things. And some of them may well even be true. But, to pity oneself as a result of them is to do oneself an enormous disservice.I think it's one of things we find unattractive about the american culture, a culture which I find mostly, extremely attractive, and I like americans and I love being in america. But, just occasionally there will be some example of the absolutely ravening self pity that they are capable of, and you see it in their talk shows. It's an appalling spectacle, and it's so self destructive. I almost once wanted to publish a self help book saying 'How To Be Happy by Stephen Fry : Guaranteed success'. And people buy this huge book and it's all blank pages, and the first page would just say - ' Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself - And you will be happy '. Use the rest of the book to write down your interesting thoughts and drawings, and that's what the book would be, and it would be true. And it sounds like 'Oh that's so simple', because it's not simple to stop feeling sorry for yourself, it's bloody hard. Because we do feel sorry for ourselves, it's what Genesis is all about."
810,happiness,"Why Not You?Today, many will awaken with a fresh sense of inspiration. Why not you?Today, many will open their eyes to the beauty that surrounds them. Why not you?Today, many will choose to leave the ghost of yesterday behind and seize the immeasurable power of today. Why not you?Today, many will break through the barriers of the past by looking at the blessings of the present. Why not you?Today, for many the burden of self doubt and insecurity will be lifted by the security and confidence of empowerment. Why not you?Today, many will rise above their believed limitations and make contact with their powerful innate strength. Why not you?Today, many will choose to live in such a manner that they will be a positive role model for their children. Why not you?Today, many will choose to free themselves from the personal imprisonment of their bad habits. Why not you?Today, many will choose to live free of conditions and rules governing their own happiness. Why not you?Today, many will find abundance in simplicity. Why not you?Today, many will be confronted by difficult moral choices and they will choose to do what is right instead of what is beneficial.

811,happiness,"Be believing, be happy, don't get discouraged. Things will work out."
812,happiness,"Sometimes you break your heart in the right way, if you know what I mean."
813,happiness,"When you find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will stand in front of you when other’s cast stones, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who will hold your hand when your sick, who thinks your pretty without makeup, the one who turns to his friends and say, ‘that’s her’, the one that would bear your rejection because losing you means losing his will to live, who kisses you when you screw up, watches the stars and names one for you and will hold and rock that baby for hours so you can sleep…..you marry him all over again."
814,happiness,"All I ask is one thing, and I’m asking this particularly of young people: please don’t be cynical. I hate cynicism, for the record, it’s my least favorite quality and it doesn’t lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you’re kind, amazing things will happen."
815,happiness,Happy girls are the prettiest
816,happiness,I don't know what good it is to know so much and be smart as whips and all if it doesn't make you happy.
817,happiness,Happiness. Simple as a glass of chocolate or tortuous as the heart. Bitter. Sweet. Alive.
818,happiness,those who do not know how to see the precious things in life will never be happy.
819,happiness,There are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness.
820,happiness,It is sometimes easier to be happy if you don't know everything.
821,happiness,"They've got no idea what happiness is, they don't know that without this love there is no happiness or unhappiness for us--there is no life."
822,happiness,"My God, a moment of bliss. Why, isn't that enough for a whole lifetime?"
823,happiness,"Wait a second,"" Four says. I turn toward him, wondering which version of Four I'll see now-the one who scolds me, or the one who climbs Ferris wheels with me. He smiles a little, but the smile doesn't spread to his eyes, which look less tense and worried.""You belong here, you know that?"" he says. ""You belong with us. It'll be over soon, so just hold on, okay?""He scratches behind his ear and looks away, like he's embarrassed by what he said. I stare at him. I feel my heartbeat everywhere, even in my toes. I feel like doing something bold, but I could just as easily walk away. I am not sure which option is smarter, or better. I am not sure that I care.I reach out and take his hand. His fingers slide between mine. I can't breathe. I stare up at him, and he stares down at me. For a long moment, we stay that way. Then I pull my hand away and run after Uriah and Lynn and Marlene. Maybe now he thinks I'm stupid, or strange. Maybe it was worth it."
824,happiness,You can't be brave if you've only had wonderful things happen to you.
825,happiness,"Pierre was right when he said that one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy, and I now believe in it. Let the dead bury the dead, but while I'm alive, I must live and be happy."
826,happiness,Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting some on yourself.
827,happiness,"It is difficult to live in and enjoy the moment when you are thinking about the past or worrying about the future. You cannot change your past, but you can ruin the present by worrying about your future. Learn from the past, plan for the future. The more you live in and enjoy the present moment, the happier you will be."
828,happiness,"Woman is not made to be the admiration of all, but the happiness of one."
829,happiness,"One swallow does not make a summer, neither does one fine day; similarly one day or brief time of happiness does not make a person entirely happy."
830,happiness,Love is too precious to be ashamed of.
831,happiness,"Dance. Smile. Giggle. Marvel. TRUST. HOPE. LOVE. WISH. BELIEVE. Most of all, enjoy every moment of the journey, and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go."
832,happiness,Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.
833,happiness,We're all golden sunflowers inside.
834,happiness,"Money may not buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in a Jaguar than on a bus."
835,happiness,Just because you are happy it does not mean that the day is perfect but that you have looked beyond its imperfections
836,happiness,Nothing makes a person happier than having a happy heart.
837,happiness,"Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness. It trains the mind through the eye, and the eye through the mind. As the sun colors flowers, so does art color life."
838,happiness,"Changing your outside world cannot make you happy if you are an unhappy person. The real personal change can only happen from the inside out. If you firstly create the change within yourself, you can turn your life around."
839,happiness,"When you connect to the silence within you, that is when you can make sense of the disturbance going on around you."
