covid_detection_by_xray_CNN_model

### Desciption of project:
It is implementation Image Classification usin  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over the real world problem. In this project I had trained model to detect between COVID-19 and normal X-rays. Used covid -19 Xray image data set avalable on github and normal x-ray dataset from kaggle dataset.
different approach were tried to for fine tunning of model. 
the idea was taken from one of the youtube tutorial  


### Learnings during project:
1. While preprocessing and extracting useful information: I had learned a lot of preprocessing aspects such as Data cleaning, Data-editing, and Data-reduction.
2. While making the model I had learned about different layers and activation functions such as Batch normalization, Drop out, Flatten, Conv2D, Relu, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax, and more.  
And had also learned about hyperparameter optimization.
3. While compiling the model the had learned about loss function, optimizer, and learning rate.
4. While fitting model I had learned about epochs, steps per epoch, batch sizes, callbacks, verbose, etc.
5. Visualization technique
6. And some more  

##### final image dataset is not uploaded due to size issues
